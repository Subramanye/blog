Hi, there ðŸ‘‹! My name is Rama. I'm a planetary science researcher and my work primarily focuses on numerical modeling of planetary surface processes. I write blogs to educate curious people and inspire people to be curious. I see this as a way of leveraging my skills to contribute to scientific community in a global scale.

## Feel free to contribute !
